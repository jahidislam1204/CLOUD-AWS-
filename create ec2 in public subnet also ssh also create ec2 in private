 Built My First Custom VPC on AWS — From Scratch! 
As part of my cloud journey, I decided to get hands-on with AWS networking and build a fully customized VPC setup. This experience helped me deeply understand how cloud networking works — especially how public and private networks communicate securely.
Here's a breakdown of what I did (and what any fresher can try too! :

 1. Created a Custom VPC

Named it test-vpc
IPv4 CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/16
Left other settings as default

 2. Added Two Subnets

  Public Subnet:
Name: test-public-subnet
CIDR: 10.0.1.0/24
AZ: us-east-1a

 Private Subnet:
Name: test-private-subnet
CIDR: 10.0.2.0/24
AZ: us-east-1a

 3. Internet Gateway Setup
Created test-igw
Attached it to the VPC

 4. Public Route Table
Name: test-public-rt
Route: 0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway
Associated it with the public subnet

 5. Security Groups for EC2 Access
  Public SG:
Allow SSH (port 22) from customize (your ip/28)
 Private SG:
Allow SSH from public subnet IP range (10.0.1.0/24)

 6. Launched EC2 Instances

  Public EC2:
Launched in the public subnet
Connected via my downloaded key pair

 Private EC2:
Launched in the private subnet
Accessed securely through the public EC2 (bastion setup)

 7. SSH Commands I Used 
 Connect to Public EC2:

chmod 400 your-key.pem
ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@<Public-IP>
